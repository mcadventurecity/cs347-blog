           <p>If I were to teach CS 347 next fall, there would be a few things I would do differently. First, I would have some sort of reading quizzes, to encourage people to actually read the textbook. This is because even I found myself lacking a reason to read before class rather than during it.</p>
           <p>Second, I would have less emphasis on the labs with at least a few lectures. I believe that lectures and labs need to be balanced, and often times focusing solely on one or the other doesn't help in the long run.</p>
           <p>Finally, I would be a bit more lenient on due dates (mainly for blog entries), as sometimes I would find myself with very little time after I got home from my part-time job on Thursday evenings. Overall, I was satisfied with this course, and I believe it will be beneficial for my skillset in the long term, but these were just a few key ideas I had to make this course more fulfilling.</p>
